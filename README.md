# Quizzical

This project features a quiz that generates questions and answers using the Fetch API. Users are presented with five questions, with a choice of multiple-choice or true/false answers. After selecting all the answers, users can verify their correctness by clicking the "Check answers" button. If they choose to play again, the quiz will load a new set of questions. I developed this project during the Learn React course on the Scrimba platform. For this assignment, only a Figma design template was provided, along with the teacher's explanation of the desired website functionality.

Technologies used:

* React
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Features

1. Dynamic Quiz Generation: The quiz generates five questions and their corresponding answers using the Fetch API, with options for multiple-choice or true/false questions.
2. Check Answers: After selecting answers for all questions, users can verify their correctness by clicking the "Check answers" button. Correct answers are highlighted with a green background, incorrect answers turn red, and remaining options shift to a lighter color.
3. Summary: A summary of the correct answers is displayed at the bottom of the questions container.
4. Play Again: Users can play the quiz again by clicking the "Play again" button, which fetches a new set of questions and answers.

## Possible improvements
1. Provide the option to choose question category and the level of difficulty.
